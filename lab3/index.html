<h1> Lab 3 - File Structures </h1>
<p> The goal of this lab was to make sure our file structure was correct and lay a good foundation for the next labs to build off of.
	<h2> Challenges</h2>
	<p> Our previous efforts to download Wes's repository of the first 6 labs, I was able to get an understading of what file structor looks like. This was not a challenge but a way for me to learn a bit more about how to start and build a website effectively.
		<h2> Results</h2>
		<p> Successful file structure layout and working links from the Homepage. I've included my file structure for this site:</p>
		<img class="screenshots" src="img/art101-file-structure.png"class= "center">
				<h3> Create an index.html in your art101 folder</h3>
				<img class="screenshots" src="img/lab3-part2.png"/>
				<p> This is how I linked my pages together and a view of what the website homepage looks like in browser.</p>
					<h3> Create an index.html in your lab3 folder</h3>
					<img class="screenshots" src="img/lab3-part3.png"/>
					<p> Here is a view of my lab 3 index.html and the lab3 view in browser before adding these screenshots.</p>
